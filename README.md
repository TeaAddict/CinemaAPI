# Cinema Api
Created this api to learn some web development.


Current features:
* Register/Login/refresh users with JWT tokens.
* Add/use "admin" roles to protect endpoints from unauthorized users.
* Do operations on tables in database like add, get, delete.
* Create Movies with description.
* Add multiple showtimes to movie, with date and time. 
* Add seats to showtime and track which seats are booked.
* Add genres to be able to group movies by genre.
* Buy movie ticket(currently actual payment transaction not implemented, only saves booking data to user account)
